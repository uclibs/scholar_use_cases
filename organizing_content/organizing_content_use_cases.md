## Submission 1 - Sub-collections
`As a:` depositor

`I want to:` be able to create sub-collections within my collection

`So that:` I can organize materials by any sub-grouping I decide

`Done looks like:` I can create a sub-collection, see all my sub-collections from the main collection page, and upload items directly into the sub-collection

## Submission 2 - Grouping of collections and/or hierarchy -- "groups" per Larry
`As a:` depositor

`I want to:` Assign specific collections to a group

`So that:` items in my collection are also part of a group

`Done looks like:` when someone is viewing a group, they can see my collection in it

## Submission 3 - Grouping of collections and/or hierarchy -- "groups" per Larry

`As a:` collection manager

`I want to:` be able to assign hierarchical structures to sub-collections

`So that:` it is clear that my sub-collections are part of a hierarchical group

`Done looks like:` when someone is viewing a hierarchical collection, visual cues such as indentations show them the hierarchical structure

## Submission 4 - Ability to create virtual collections or groupings as needed

`As a:` user of the repository 

`I want to:` categorize my items in my collections or groups along parameters I define, such as format, author, or keyword

`So that:` my virtual collection is automatically created with works per the rules I have created (e.g., all of my works tagged with the keyword 'Communism')

`Done looks like:` when someone arrives on my user page, they can easily see the virtual collections I have created

## Submission 5 - Support for easily customizable online web exhibits derived from repository content

`As a:` user of the repository

`I want to:` select specific items I see in the repository for an online exhibit

`So that:` my exhibit may contain works from different depositors, collections, or groups, but it is clear that this is my own assemblage of works from others

`Done looks like:` my exhibit can be accessed and shared with others

## Submission 6 - Granular levels of authorization for administrative functions of existing records in specific collections, based on credentials
`As a:` collection manager

`I want to:` delegate permission to certain individuals to be able to manage/edit items and metadata for records already in a collection

`So that:` those individuals can login and edit things only where I've given permission

`Done looks like:` Individuals can login and manage items within certain areas, without access to other areas, and I can grant these granular permissions

## Submission 7 - Read-only access for group members

`As a:` group manager 

`I want:` to be able to set permissions for group members

`So that:` I can choose between read-only and editing access for group members

`Done looks like:` when group members login, they can only edit or read materials based on the levels I have specified


## Submission  8 - Groups
`As a:` member of a group

`I want:` to see what works I have granted group access to/or others' works I am able to edit

`So that:`  I do not have to open an individual item's record to see which groups I have given access to or items which I am able to edit

`Done looks like:` When I view my group, I see which works my group has access to 

*This submission is ideal for a dashboard*


##Submission 9 - Display of content in collections # Early Adopter
`As a:` collection manager

`I want to:` have my content in a collection displayed in a collapsible folder-like structure of sub-collections

`So that:` users can open and close menus to see the files they want

`Done looks like:` when a user is viewing my collection page they see a series of folder links they can click to open or close, and see the files associated with each sub-collection
